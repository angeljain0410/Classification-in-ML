# Classification-in-ML

I have used a small dataset of five different fruits and done some data processing and visualization on the same. Also, I have applied different models to have highest accuracy among them.

Among below mentioned Classification models:-
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
4. Gaussian Naive Bias
5. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

**KNN has hiighest accuracy at K=5.**
